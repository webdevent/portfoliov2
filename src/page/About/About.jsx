        <strong>Here are a few things about me: </strong>
        Since completing my CAPES (Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examination) in Accounting, Communication Studies, and Entrepreneurship, I have worked at a Bank doing data entry, I am a self-motivated, reliable, and disciplined individual who strives to develop myself holistically and to develop skills and knowledge further. I am attentive to details, and a good team player but I am also able to differentiate when a task demands independence, I want to be a part of your organization because I want to get a better understanding of life as a Software Engineer i am currently at an intermediate level in front-end development and currently in the process of reaching an intermediate level in back-end development and to further advance my skills in the field of computer science by completing the projects and tasks that you assign to me, I fully understand that you arenâ€™t just looking for someone hard-working alone but someone who can also grow and develop with the organization, I believe I will be a great fit for this position because of my skills in Problem Solving, computer systems, information technologies, and my ability to learn new skills and technologies quickly.
